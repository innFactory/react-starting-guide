### Inline Styles
We will use Inline Styles instead of putting the styles into separate CSS files (it's a very common practise in the react community). To see what inline styles are and how to use it visit the [repository of JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss). There are some other libs like aphrodite which are providing also inline styles but JSS is our choice.

* Task: delete all css files in the tutorial above and use inline styles with JSS (You can defenitly play around, get familiar with styling and make it pretty)
